# Simple Twitter Bot
I made this to be able to have some fun with my friends. They go to a different university than me and I thought why not make a twitter bot that enables me to interact with them.
This bot is based off the meme "kissing homies good night".

## How it works
A user sends the bot a dm with the person's @ for which they want the bot to messeage. The bot reads the last twenty dms and looks at the dm ids. It stores the last id that it saw in a txt file to make sure it doesn't repeat tweet at people.

### Notes
An easy way to run this script would be by having events setup on your computer that run it automatically. That is if you expect other people to use and get close to about twenty dms every couple of hours. You would want this bot running several times throughout the day to take care of it. As of now, when I'm writing this, I just tend to run the bot once at night.
